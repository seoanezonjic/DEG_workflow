<h1> Short overlapping reads analysis report. </h1>

<p>This report contains the information of the analysis done for each sample for the detection of reads whose top percentage of the sequence (80% or higher) does not match the reference genome.
Fragments of reads that do not align against the reference (soft clip) are included in a FASTA file that is analyzed with BLAST to identify the provenance of those reads and to determine if they are contaminants that may alter the results of differential expression analysis.</p>

<p> Table ${ plotter.add_table('tab:inputTable.txt') } includes BLAST matches with a identity percentage over 95 and a query coverage per subject over 95. Results are filtered out to get uniq records.</p>
